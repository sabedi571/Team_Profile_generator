# Team_Profile_generator

This app lets an employer keep a databse for there employees. 

Its divided in to three categories of employees. Managers, Interns and Engineers.

I used switch and case function to execute the function i wanted, once the user selects an emplyee type.

Then user is presented with prompts to provide information about an emplyee that is specific to the role.

at the end you are presented with a team html file in the output folder.

Please see the screenshot for the end product.
